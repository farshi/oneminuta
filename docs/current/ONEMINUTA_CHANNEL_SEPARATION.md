## Business Logic Implementation

### Channel Type Detection
```python
# Automatic detection
asset_manager.get_channel_type("@oneminuta_property")  # ‚Üí "official"
asset_manager.get_channel_type("@phuketgid")          # ‚Üí "partner"
asset_manager.get_channel_type("@unknown")            # ‚Üí "unknown"
```

### Operations Control
```python
# Property collection (partners only)
asset_manager.should_collect_from_channel("@oneminuta_property")  # ‚Üí False
asset_manager.should_collect_from_channel("@phuketgid")           # ‚Üí True

# Analytics tracking (both)
asset_manager.should_track_analytics("@oneminuta_property")       # ‚Üí True
asset_manager.should_track_analytics("@phuketgid")                # ‚Üí True
```

## CLI Commands

### View All Partners
```bash
python oneminuta_cli.py partners
```
Shows all configured partners and their channels.

### Official Channel Analytics Only
```bash
python oneminuta_cli.py analytics --official
```
Shows OneMinuta company channel performance (brand reach, member growth).

### All Channels Combined
```bash
python oneminuta_cli.py analytics
```
Shows combined analytics but separates official vs partner metrics.

### Partner-Specific Analytics (Future)
```bash
python oneminuta_cli.py analytics --partner partner_phuketgid
```
Will show analytics for specific partner's channels only.
